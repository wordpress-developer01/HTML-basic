    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish originating from the Lazio region. It's made with simple ingredients, including eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper, resulting in a creamy and flavorful sauce that perfectly coats the pasta.</p>
    <p>This dish is beloved for its rich, savory taste and is often enjoyed as a comforting and indulgent meal. With its minimal ingredients and quick preparation time, itâ€™s a favorite for both weeknight dinners and special occasions.</p>

    <h2>Steps to Cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat and cook the pancetta (or bacon) until crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs and grated Parmesan cheese. Add freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet with pancetta to low heat. Add the drained spaghetti and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and slowly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing constantly to create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water as needed to adjust the consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan and black pepper if desired.</li>
